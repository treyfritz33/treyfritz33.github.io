<p>Robert Williams was drafted in 2018 with the 27th pick in the 1st round by the Boston Celtics. It was a bit of a rough start for Williams, missing his flight to Boston after the draft led him to missing his first practice. Due to this slip up a few of his fellow Celtics decided to give him the nickname TimeLord, and it has stuck ever since.</p>
<p>After missing that flight things started to get much better for Williams. Though his numbers through his first couple years didn’t blow anyone away, he would make his presence known in the small amount of minutes he was getting. Fast forward a few years and Williams is one of the best centers in the league. He has put on pounds of muscle while never losing his insane jumping ability. With a wingspan of 7’5 1/2 and a 6’9 frame, Williams is not easy to get past; he clogs up the lane more than a baby shoving toys into the toilet.</p>
<p>This year TimeLord has taken a huge leap defensively and offensively, but we are going to focus on his defense. His number of blocks, defensive rebounds and steals have all jumped up. Most importantly his blocks have gone up from 1.3 to 2.2, thats adding another block every game.</p>
<p>Looking at a very important stat for defensive players now, defensive win shares, Williams has gone from .6 to 3.9. A defensive win share is the number of wins a player contributes due to their defense, so in short Rob is winning the Celtics games with his defense. His overall defensive win share ranks 5th in the league, the leader of this stat is his superstar teammate Jayson Tatum. Besides Tatum, Williams is right behind Rudy Gobert, and I mean RIGHT behind. Gobert, the center for the Utah Jazz, is considered one, if not the best defensive player in the league and has won defensive player of the year three times.</p>

So Williams is in good company, his stats are starting to speak for themselves and it is only a matter of time before people start to notice and give him some recognition, considering him for DPOY.</p>
<p>While having a good defensive win share is great, Williams is also starting to get near the top in a few other key stats - defensive box plus minus and block percentage. Defensive box plus minus is an estimate of the defensive points a player contributes every 100 possessions above a league-average player, and the block percentage is an estimate on how many two point shots are blocked while a player is on the floor.</p>

While Williams is not at the top in these categories he still has yet to hit his prime. Once he does and gets another year or so under his belt I wouldn’t be surprised if Williams is leading in both of these categories.</p>
<p>Some of you may still be doubting that Williams is about to emerge as one of the best defensive players in the league, so to show how good TimeLord is playing, the following shows the number of blocks and steals Williams has compared to the three time DPOY Rudy Gobert.</p>

Gobert barely beats out Williams in blocks, having just three more, but Williams has 11 more steals. Gobert is five years older than Rob, five years, and Williams is putting up similar numbers now. His growth will continue and he will become an absolute menace to opposing offenses. Next year Robert Williams is going to make a run for DPOY, and don’t be surprised if he comes out on top.</p>
