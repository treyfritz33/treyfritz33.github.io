      <description>Robert Williams was drafted in 2018 with the 27th pick in the 1st round by the Boston Celtics. It was a bit of a rough start for Williams, missing his flight to Boston after the draft lead him to missing his first practice. After this slip up a few of his fellow Celtics decided to give him the nickname TimeLord, and it has stuck ever since.
After missing that flight things started to get much better for Rob, while his numbers through his first couple years didn’t blow anyone away he would make his presence known in the small amount of minutes he was getting.</description>

With a record of 17-19 before the start of the new year the Celtics were disappointing everyone. Somehting clicked in January, nobody is sure what happened, but some credit a Tweet from Celtics star Jaylen Brown that said, “The energy is about to shift”.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
